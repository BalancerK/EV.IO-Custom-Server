/**
 * bot_difficulty.js — maps the single 1-10 Bot Level slider to concrete combat-skill parameters.
 *
 * Design agreed before any bot code was written: scale SKILL, not stats. HP, damage, and movement
 * speed are identical at every level — only how well a bot points a gun and reacts changes. A
 * stat-boosted bot reads as cheating, because the client has no visual language for it (unlike the
 * real boss flag, opcode 239 / Qqw6dra). Navigation competence is likewise constant across levels —
 * a bot that can't find its way around isn't "easy", it's broken; difficulty lives entirely in the
 * combat layer (see driveBotFrame in local_ws_server.js, which is the only consumer of this module).
 *
 * Every axis eases along t = (level-1)/9 with an EASE-OUT curve (skill improves fast early, refines
 * slowly at the top) — matching how human proficiency actually plateaus, so level 9 and 10 don't
 * read as identical to level 5 and 6.

  // plateaus) but wrong for raw aim precision: it made mid-and-low levels sharpshoot almost as well
  // as the top of the curve (e.g. level 5 landed at ~4.7° instead of the ~7.3° a straight line gives),
