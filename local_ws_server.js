// ── Envelope `sync` — the server→client CLOCK-SYNC channel ───────────────────────────────
// The packet is [sync, clientTick, body]. `sync` is NOT a server tick counter: the client
// assigns it straight to `lagAccumulator` (bundle :27351) and derives its own tick period from
// it every animation frame (:27277):
//
//     period = TICK_MS + lagAccumulator * n + tickErrorCount        // n = 2 (SyncHandler :27244)
//
// So `sync` is how the server tells the client to speed up or slow down. Semantics come from the
// client's own pre-game path, which computes it locally as `stateBuffer.length - 1` (:27331):
// the number of SURPLUS server states the client has buffered. 0 = perfectly paced.
//   sync = 0  → period 50ms → exactly 20Hz, matching the client's sim rate.
//   sync > 0  → client slows down (it has a backlog of states to burn through).
//   sync < 0  → DISABLES reconciliation entirely (`lagAccumulator < 0` → Qak2r7y returns -1,
//               :27372), so never send a negative value unless that is what you want.
//
// We used to send `globalTick` here — an unbounded counter. At tick 1000 that asks the client for
// a 2050ms tick period; a stock client would simply stop sending input. It only ever worked
// because userscript patch 6d3 clamps the incoming sync to ±3 — which pinned the client at the
// ceiling, +3, i.e. a 56ms period = 17.86Hz against our 20Hz server. That permanent ~2Hz
// mismatch is a real desync: the client also never resets `lagCounter` (it only resets while
// lagAccumulator < 0), so it periodically hits "Skipping a server state to keep up" (:27348) and
// DROPS a server state whenever its buffer exceeds 2.
//
// All three official captures show `sync = 0` on every server→client packet. Default "zero"
// reproduces that. "adaptive" additionally nudges the client when OUR input queue tells us it is

//                       error at lag 3 — this was the rotation stutter, and it scaled with the lag.
//   inputBufferDepth  — hold the tick back and simulate later, so lastProcessedClientTick is
//                       genuinely older AND the body really is that tick's state. Label and body
//                       agree, the comparison is apples to apples, and no correction is provoked.

// An earlier version of this widened inputBufferDepth PER SESSION based on burstLevel (extra target
// depth for a session whose own input kept arriving in bursts). Replaced by a simpler mechanism:
// inputBufferMaxCatchup below is now a small FIXED cap for every session, always — a burst just
// drains gradually over a few extra real ticks instead of being caught up in one, the same "reveal
// at a bounded rate, let the queue absorb the rest" shape already used for peer-broadcast smoothing
// (pushReplaySnapshot/popReplayTarget) and now for input consumption too. That intrinsically buys
// the same jitter tolerance the reactive widening did, without needing to detect "who is struggling"
// and reach into a per-session knob to fix it — every session gets smooth draining uniformly, and
// inputQueueMaxTicks (unchanged) remains the overflow backstop for a backlog too large to smooth
// through, exactly mirroring peerReplayQueueMax's role on the broadcast side.

// Max client-ticks processed in one server tick when catching up a backed-up queue.
//
// DEFAULT 16. Briefly dropped to 2 in an attempt to smooth server-side CPU cost during a burst, but
// that smoothing goal turned out to be REDUNDANT once the peer-replay-queue existed: peer-visible
// smoothness during a burst is already fully handled by pacing the REVEAL to peers (peerReplayQueueMax/
// popReplayTarget), independent of how fast we actually drain the backlog server-side. With that
// concern already covered elsewhere, a low catchup value bought nothing but extra delay — every tick
// a bursty/high-ping session's backlog sits undrained is a tick their actions are NOT yet
// authoritative, on top of whatever raw network latency they already have. Restored to 16, which
// this project already measured safe under real load (a 300-tick backlog across 38 firing players
// cleared in under 500ms with zero tick overruns) — the actual overrun problem historically only

// account loadout says. Why this exists: the two remaining reconciler work-arounds (userscript
// 6b7 pitch/pitchOffset skip + 6b8 recoil/ammo preserve) both hang off the GUN path —
//   • ammo/reload divergence is gone outright: the sword's clipSize is 999999 and the client's
//     reload gate (`ammoInMag < 9999`, bundle :43981) can therefore never fire, so there is no
//     magazine state left to preserve through a reconcile reset.
//   • zooming (a compared field) is gone: no melee weapon has field_weapon_data.zoom.
//   • recoil still exists — the sword has knockback 2 and the client's arm (Qmgh2i6, :34614) is
//     NOT gated on melee — but the sword's cooldown is 16 ticks while the recoil curve dies at
//     actionTickCounter > 9 (l(), :34626). The kick fully settles between swings, so it can never
//     accumulate the way sustained auto-rifle fire does. We keep reproducing it server-side
//     (armRecoil) so it stays in parity rather than becoming a new divergence.

// 260 weaponTypeId (52 smoke / 53 flash), 262 isArmed. Grenades are server-authoritative
// (the client's cast discards its local projectile), so the thrower sees it ~1 buffer tick
// after release. The client renders the flying grenade and plays the smoke/flash on removal.

// The client CANNOT simulate a server-spawned grenade: its grenade physics (Q4z2d8n
// .sendInputFrame, bundle ~43884) bails with "missing collider" because the collider is
// only registered by the client's own spawn (Qo1ywyz), which never runs for our entity.
// So the client just RENDERS the position (248) we stream. We must run the full arc on the
// server and stream position every tick. projVelocity (249) is cosmetic on the client (facing
// + a short trail), sent at the client's small scale. Speed/gravity are TUNABLE u/s values
// (the streamed position is the source of truth, not the catalogue per-tick numbers).
// Throw speed, PER WEAPON, straight from the catalogue's `projectileSpeed` (u/client-tick).
// Our velocities are u/s and the client ticks at 20Hz, so the conversion is x20.
//
// This was hardcoded to 42 ("1.5x the old 28") while the comment at the spawn site correctly
// documented projectileSpeed = 0.9 — i.e. 18 u/s. Throwing 2.33x too fast flattens the arc, and a
// flat arc reads as "gravity is too weak" even when gravity is exactly right. Both halves of the
// trajectory have to come from the catalogue or neither matches.
// MEASURED from the official server, not taken from the catalogue. Telemetry over 83 live
// projectiles (evio-throwable-logger v3) gives a launch speed of ~1.50 u/tick for EVERY hand-thrown
// grenade:
//     HE 1.4948   Sticky 1.5020   Impulse 1.5139   Flash 1.4667   GrenadeLauncher 1.5121
// while the catalogue lists projectileSpeed 0.9 for all of them. The Grenade Launcher is the tell:
// it is the one weapon whose catalogue value IS 1.5, and it measures the same as the rest. So
// `projectileSpeed` governs weapon-FIRED projectiles; ability THROWS use a fixed ~1.5 and ignore it.
//
// 1.5 u/tick x 20 = 30 u/s. That also reconciles both play reports: the old hand-tuned 42 threw too
// flat, the catalogue-derived 18 too short.
//

// ── Peer-broadcast position smoothing ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// REPORTED SYMPTOM: a player with a high/unstable ping (200-400ms, packet loss) appears to OTHER
// players as constantly teleporting instead of moving smoothly — even though the player's own
// connection is server-authoritative and their true simulated position is correct every tick.
//
// ROOT CAUSE: a stalled connection delivers input in BURSTS (TCP head-of-line blocking — one lost
// packet stalls everything behind it until retransmission, then it all arrives at once). When that
// burst is drained, processBufferedTick correctly advances the player's TRUE position through every
// buffered tick — but the broadcast only samples the FINAL result once, at the end of that one
// server tick. Up to INPUT_BUFFER_MAX_CATCHUP ticks' worth of real movement (up to 3+ seconds at the
// live default) lands in a single visible update. Every OTHER client's peer-interpolation (lerp
// between the last two states it received) has no way to know that jump represents several seconds
// of motion rather than one 50ms tick, so it renders as an instant teleport.
//
// FIX: peers are shown a SEPARATE, SMOOTHED position that eases toward the true simulated position
// at a bounded max speed — decoupled from however bursty the source player's own connection is. This
// is what makes "server peers isolated from client condition" literal: the peer view is authored by
// the server's own pacing, never by however input happened to arrive. The player's OWN client still
// sees (and reconciles against) the TRUE position — self-view is intentionally untouched, both
// because the player's own reconciliation needs the real value and because lag-compensated hit
// registration (recordPositionSnapshot/positionAtTick) reads the true simulated position, never this
// smoothed one. Genuine instant repositioning (teleporter, respawn, admin teleport) SNAPS instead of
// easing — those are meant to look instantaneous, not like a fast slide.

// and this specific idea turned out to be the WRONG direction to chase it in, not just an
// incomplete one.
//
// During a real input gap, processBufferedTick correctly refuses to guess (see its own "Holding is
// right for a BRIEF gap" comment) — advancing the AUTHORITATIVE position without real input would
// drift it away from whatever the client actually did. The peer-replay queue (pushReplaySnapshot/
// popReplayTarget, above) exists for exactly this reason: it is a STRICT replay of real, already-
// simulated positions, never a guess, so what a peer sees is always literally what happened, just
// delayed by however deep the backlog is.
//
// This extrapolation layer breaks that guarantee, and was a mistake to default on: while starved it
// guesses ahead on last-known velocity, and when real data resumes it eases from that GUESS toward
// the first real queued position — which can be a LARGER, more visible correction than simply
// staying frozen would have needed, if the guess was wrong (the player actually stopped, turned, or
// hit a wall). That trades "briefly frozen, then exactly right" for "confidently wrong, then a snap
// to fix it" — worse instability, not less. Reconciling a mispredicted position belongs on the
// CLIENT side (the existing echo/lag-comp reconcile loop), which is what it is for; the server's
// peer-broadcast layer should only ever show real, already-known-true data, never invent it.
// Left in as an explicit opt-in (0 = off, the recommended and default setting) rather than deleted
// outright, in case a future, more careful design wants a bounded, reconciled version of this idea —

// depends ONLY on (playerId, playerState), never on who is receiving it. Confirmed by inspection:
// the function has zero recipient parameter and mutates nothing on playerState (no assignment to
// any playerState.* field anywhere in its body) — so the SAME player's block is byte-identical
// across every recipient within one tick, and recomputing it for each one is pure waste. Measured
// as the dominant term in the O(N^2) CPU growth this project's load tests found (~0.048 * N^2 in
// the fitted curve). With bots about to raise N substantially, this is worth fixing correctly.
//
// Cached per PLAYER ID, tagged with the TICK it was built for. Tagging (rather than relying solely
// on "cleared once per broadcast phase") is what makes this safe for BOTH call sites: the normal
// per-global-tick broadcast loop, and the hybrid-mode "input-paced" immediate response, which calls
// buildTickBody with `nextTick = globalTick + 1` from an entirely different code path, mid-cycle,
// before the main loop has advanced globalTick to that value. Without the tag, that path could
// either read a stale block (serving position/velocity from before this tick's integration) or
// pollute the cache for a tick number the broadcast loop has not reached yet. The tag makes a
// lookup for the wrong tick a guaranteed miss, so correctness never depends on WHEN something
// clears the map — only on WHAT tick each entry claims to be for.
//
// The map is a module-level singleton (matching the existing style of activeEntities and friends)
// rather than a broadcast-loop local, precisely because both call sites need to share it. It is

 * does `g[entityId] ||= createPlayerPropStore(); g[entityId][propKey] = propValue`.
 * So the client builds the FULL default store itself (no partial-store crash) and
 * we only override the fields we know — here SKIN_URL (the body skin), resolved

 *
 * Wire format (see WS dispatch, case '~'): '~' + code + '`' + JSON. entityId is the

 *
 * CRITICAL — OBFUSCATED FIELD NAMES. The client reads the OBFUSCATED property names,
 * NOT the human-readable deobfuscated ones. Verified against evidence/web/assets/bundle.js:
 *   roster entry: { Qwhkhza:<entityId>, Qcxi0k5:<propKey>, Qcou9jy:<propValue> }

 * The propKey (Qcxi0k5) must be the PlayerPropKey VALUE, also obfuscated:
 *   SKIN_URL -> 'Qh52c4d'  (createPlayerPropStore default: Qh52c4d:'.../default_2.evskin')
 * The renderer reads m.Qh52c4d for the body skin. Using the deobfuscated names

  // If the global loop sends a tick to a newly-accepted player before their
  // first render frame, it lands in Qorty0h immediately. On the first render
  // frame, Qwhlcfo tries to read Qxo2o14[0] → undefined → Uncaught TypeError
