/**
 * navmesh_pathfinder.js — waypoint-graph pathfinding for bots.
 *
 * The evmap navmesh (physics_world.js, flags2&1) is already a symmetrised graph — position + link
 * indices, one array per map. Bots need two things on top of that raw graph:
 *   1. Teleporters treated as extra edges. ~6 of the 20 maps have a navmesh split across multiple
 *      disconnected islands that are only actually joined in-game by a portal pad — without this, a
 *      bot on one island could never path to a target on another even though a human player could
 *      just walk through the teleporter.
 *   2. A* search from an arbitrary world position to another, snapping to the nearest graph nodes.
 *
 * This module is pure: it takes the navmesh + teleporters physics_world.js already parses and
 * returns a graph plus a search function. It has no knowledge of bots, sessions, or physics state —
 * kept standalone and unit-testable before anything drives it (see scripts/test_navmesh.js).
